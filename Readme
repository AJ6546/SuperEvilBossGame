# spring22-jam-team-6
 Super Evil Boss Game.
 This is a fun little game I have enjoyed building for the Spring 22 Game Jam. 
 The idea is rooted in the question - What happens to all the defeated Game Bosses? ( Which I think has cool potential for a big game)
 This is just a small fragment of the possibilities that the question opens up and I don't think that I have done justice to it. 
 But it is a fun game (I hope) that I enjoyed building. Hope you like it too!
 The game is going to be 5 rounds of boss fights, which is made pretty clear in the intro.
 You will need to be connected to internet as I am using real time database to save the progress.
 You can Register with any thing that goes with email format (a@b.com) and password (6 degits)
 Log in with the same. Or play as a guest in which case you won't be able to recollect the data incase you, decide to log out, uninstall the app or play on a different device.
Please download the game form
